## Projects

### IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING CUSTOM & PRE-TRAINED CLASSIFICATION MODELS
[Repo](https://github.com/NicoleK286/Insect-Image-Classification-Object-Detection)

Optimized several pre-trained and custom CNN models including DenseNet, MobileNet and InceptionV3 to achieve an accuracy of greater than 75% in the classification of annotated and unannotated insect images, at the Order Taxonomic level.

### MULTIVARIATE WEB BASED SEARCH SUITE FOR CLINICAL TRIALS
[Repo](https://github.com/NicoleK286/Clinical-Trial-Search-Suite)

Designed a web interface with a multivariate search using Javascript, PHP, HTML and CSS to lookup clinical trial information stored in a SQL database. Designed the platform to be scalable as the complexity of the application increases.

### STUDYING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE PATTERNS USING MEDICARE HEALTH INSURANCE DATA
[Repo](https://github.com/NicoleK286/Medicare_Project)
